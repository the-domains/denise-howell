            <title><![CDATA[This WEEK in LAW]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This WEEK in LAW</h1><h2>Friday, September 2, 2016. 11 PT/18:00 UTC</h2><p>I’m thrilled to welcome Professor Margot Kaminski back to This WEEK in LAW this coming Friday. Professor Kaminski focuses on so many areas we enjoy discussing on the show, including “media freedom, online civil liberties, international intellectual property law, legal issues raised by AI and robotics, and surveillance.” Co-host Mike Keyes and I are excited to see what Professor Kaminski thinks about the new FAA commercial drone rules as well as the legality of shooting drones out of the sky, the return of Naruto (and whether courts need to defer to the copyright office on questions of copyrightability), Pokemon Go (real world permits and cyberspace permissions), the Tolkien estate protects The Precious, whether Frank Ocean’s Apple Music exclusive ramped up piracy, and much more. I’m aggregating potential topics on Flipboard and Tagpacker; let me know if you have other suggestions!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/faecd5cf-7a1b-430a-89bd-9c11b49a9ad0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This is why drones and balloons don't like to play together - DIY Photography</h1><p>Drone pilots have unique, close-to-the-ground aerial considerations to navigate because (for example in the cinematography context) they may need to fly directly into and around obstacles other aircraft can better avoid. In addition to thinking about and planning for this with clients — which as this piece demonstrates is a wise precaution — commercial drone operators should pay attention to insuring against their own loss/damage, and not just the risks their activities may pose to others. Consider too who should bear the expense of insuring particular jobs. The answer may be different if the footage is documenting a wedding or destined for a blockbuster.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/3afbf7cb7e11c1332666f95287cba24d/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.diyphotography.net%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fdrone-broken-01.jpg"></article>]]></description>
