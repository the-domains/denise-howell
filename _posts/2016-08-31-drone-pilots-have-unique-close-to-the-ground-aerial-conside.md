title: This is why drones and balloons don't like to play together - DIY Photography
publisher: {}
description: >-
  Drone pilots have unique, close-to-the-ground aerial considerations to
  navigate because (for example in the cinematography context) they may need to
  fly directly into and around obstacles other aircraft can better avoid. In
  addition to thinking about and planning for this with clients — which as this
  piece demonstrates is a wise precaution — commercial drone operators should
  pay attention to insuring against their own loss/damage, and not just the
  risks their activities may pose to others. Consider too who should bear the
  expense of insuring particular jobs. The answer may be different if the
  footage is documenting a wedding or destined for a blockbuster.
