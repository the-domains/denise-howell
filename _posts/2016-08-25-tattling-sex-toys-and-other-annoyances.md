  I suggest you join us Friday for This WEEK in LAW if it’s not already firm on
  your calendar. My stupendous co-hosts Mike Keyes and Emory Roane will be there
  too, and we have a particularly wide-ranging list of topics we’re pondering
  for the show. From “turning the American justice system into little more than
  a computer programming problem,” to the short half-life of Pokemon Uranium, to
  the interplay between trolling and free speech…we have much to discuss!
