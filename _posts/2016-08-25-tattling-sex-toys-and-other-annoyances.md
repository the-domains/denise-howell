# Tattling sex toys and other annoyances
![Cool cat Marc Randazza will join us for Friday's TWiL](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8ccdcbcb-fb94-40e3-b731-1aabf8cdb306.jpg)

I suggest you join us Friday for [This WEEK in LAW][0] if it's not already firm on your calendar. Back by popular demand is First Amendment and IP lawyer [Marc Randazza][1]. My stupendous co-hosts [Mike Keyes][2] and [Emory Roane][3] will be there too, and we have a particularly wide-ranging [list of topics][4] we're pondering for the show. From "[turning the American justice system into little more than computer programming problem][5]," to the [short half-life][6] of Pokemon Uranium, to updates on the legal woes of [Axanar][7] and [podcasting][8], to the interplay between trolling and free speech...we have much to discuss!

[Join us live][9] 8/26/16, 11 PT/18:00 UTC.
