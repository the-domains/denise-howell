It's at least the third time this has happened in the U.S., with previous incidents in Kentucky and Tennessee. Originally reported in the local Fauquier Times and subsequently covered by Ars Technica, the shooter was Jennifer Youngman, a neighbor to actor and director Robert Duvall.</p></article>

> Shooting down drones is a bit of a legal gray area in the United States at the moment.
